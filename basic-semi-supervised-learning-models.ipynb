It's quite simple. Intuitively, it looks and sounds like a clustering algorithm that just \"propagate\" labels to nearest data points. But we need to go a little bit deeper.\n\nY is our label matrix, it has size of $(l+u)\\times C$, where l - amount of labeled data points, u - amount of unlabeled data points, C - number of classes. So in binary classification task we will get 2 columns. It's kind of list that we will get from `predict_proba` method.\n\nThe algorithm will create a fully connected graph where nodes are **all** the data points. The edges between nodes will be weights $w_{i,j}$: \n\n$$w_{i,j} = exp(\\frac{d_{i,j}^2}{\\sigma^2})$$\n\nwhere *d* - distance function (euclidean in this case, but in general could be any distance function you want), $\\sigma$ - hyperparameter, that control (shrink) weights.\n\nThen we build probabilistic transition matrix T: \n\n$$T_{i,j} = \\frac{w_{i,j}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{l+u}w_{i,j}}$$\n\nT is just a matrix with probability of every data point to be in class C. Our labeled data points has 1.0 probability to be in class C (since we know their classes) and unlabeled data will get their classes from neighbours (we calculated weights earlier, they depend on distance between 2 points).\n\nThe whole algorithm looks like this:\n1. Propagate Y <- TY (we \"propagate\" labels from labeled data to unlabeled)\n2. Row-normalize Y (value of element in row / sum of all elements values in row)\n3. Clamp the labeled data (we fixinig our labeled data, so our algorithm won't change probability of class, or in another words change the label)\n4. Repeat from step 1 until Y converges (we recalculate or distances and weights, that will give us different transition matrix that will change our belief in assigned labels, repeat until process converge).\n\nIn case of `sklearn` implementation we have a choice of weightening function: RBF (see formula for $w_{i,j}$) or KNN ($1(x' \\in kNN(x))$). KNN is faster and gives sparse representation. RBF is harder to compute and store dense transition matrix in memory, but has more options for tuning. Also sklearn RBF implementation instead of dividing by $\\sigma^2$ multiply it by `gamma`, so it should be float, not integer.\n\nTo learn more you can read [this](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jerryzhu/pub/CMU-CALD-02-107.pdf) and [this](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/label_propagation.html#label-propagation). `sklearn` also has some cool examples of `LabelPropagation`: [SVM vs LP](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/semi_supervised/plot_label_propagation_versus_svm_iris.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-semi-supervised-plot-label-propagation-versus-svm-iris-py), [LP demo](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/semi_supervised/plot_label_propagation_structure.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-semi-supervised-plot-label-propagation-structure-py), [LP digits recognition](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/semi_supervised/plot_label_propagation_digits.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-semi-supervised-plot-label-propagation-digits-py) and [LP digits active learning](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/semi_supervised/plot_label_propagation_digits_active_learning.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-semi-supervised-plot-label-propagation-digits-active-learning-py)."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"7068d06eff853d2def96527fc390d4a21e67e3c1"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now I will define a little function that will give us a plot of ROC AUC of our algorithm depending on our kernel and parameter list."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"9ec08aee4185f9d0688cd3df9ef1bd5be5ca0333"},"cell_type":"code","source":"def label_prop_test(kernel, params_list, X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test):\n    plt.figure(figsize=(20,10))\n    n, g = 0, 0\n    roc_scores = []\n    if kernel == 'rbf':\n        for g in params_list:\n            lp = LabelPropagation(kernel=kernel, n_neighbors=n, gamma=g, max_iter=100000, tol=0.0001)\n            lp.fit(X_train, y_train)\n            roc_scores.append(roc_auc_score(y_test, lp.predict_proba(X_test)[:,1]))\n    if kernel == 'knn':\n        for n in params_list:\n            lp = LabelPropagation(kernel=kernel, n_neighbors=n, gamma=g, max_iter=100000, tol=0.0001)\n            lp.fit(X_train, y_train)\n            roc_scores.append(roc_auc_score(y_test, lp.predict_proba(X_test)[:,1]))\n    plt.figure(figsize=(16,8));\n    plt.plot(params_list, roc_scores)\n    plt.title('Label Propagation ROC AUC with ' + kernel + ' kernel')\n    plt.show()\n    print('Best metrics value is at {}'.format(params_list[np.argmax(roc_scores)]))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"72a9d13c2304d53cbfb9542e8ab3b9495925dc92"},"cell_type":"code","source":"gammas = [9e-6, 1e-5, 2e-5, 3e-5, 4e-5, 5e-5, 6e-5, 7e-5, 8e-5, 9e-5]\nlabel_prop_test('rbf', gammas, X_1_2, X_3, y_1_2, y_3)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"cc28308c088c0c190b64952df2ffa0fa84c9ec8a"},"cell_type":"code","source":"ns = np.arange(50,60)\nlabel_prop_test('knn', ns, X_1_2, X_3, y_1_2, y_3)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"a1fb818b52439530b45c97c39c42eed6c7a0045f"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now you can define your model separately with the best (or whatever) hyperparameter value and check its score"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"b12564e15d37440bc009a0db14fea6f0c7faecc7"},"cell_type":"code","source":"lp_rbf = LabelPropagation(kernel='rbf', gamma=9e-6, max_iter=100000, tol=0.0001)\nlp_rbf.fit(X_1_2, y_1_2)\nresults = results.append(pd.Series(['Label Propagation RBF', \n                                    roc_auc_score(y_3, lp_rbf.predict_proba(X_3)[:,1])], index=index), ignore_index=True)\n\nlp_knn = LabelPropagation(kernel='knn', n_neighbors=53, max_iter=100000, tol=0.0001)\nlp_knn.fit(X_1_2, y_1_2)\nresults = results.append(pd.Series(['Label Propagation KNN', \n                                    roc_auc_score(y_3, lp_knn.predict_proba(X_3)[:,1])], index=index), ignore_index=True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"56e6eb3210a816c1d7cf5daedf6654339535b5e3"},"cell_type":"code","source":"results","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"f1611f6b679e5e378a717441fe5d14cb83d3f54b"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now let's talk about time.
